The eventual goal of this project is to take in a picture of any format and 
return a new picture of the same format that has the pixels sorted by color.
Right now it's nonfunctional, I'm just trying to get used to using git so I 
figured that I'd push new things as they happened.

Update 2016 May 18
* Input and output utilities work
* I've realized that I'm building a command line tool to manipulate images which is actually kinda funny if you think about it
* diff confirms that input and output are the same which makes sense because the image isn't being processed at all
* I've realized that I'm building a command line tool to manipulate images
* Next thing is going to be actually processing the data now that I have it


Good luck!
